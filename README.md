## Introduction

**nf-cmgg/exomecnv** is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to call copy number variations (CNVs) from exome sequencing data with ExomeDepth and annotate these with EnsemblVEP. It takes a samplesheet with CRAM or BAM files and their index files as input, generates read count data, calls CNVs and ends with an annotation. It is also possible to take a samplesheet with VCF files and their index files as input and only execute the annotation.

## Pipeline Summary

1. Input samplesheet check
2. Convert CRAM to BAM if CRAM files are provided (optional)
3. ExomeDepth counting per sample (autosomal and chrX are separated)
4. Merge count files per pool (autosomal and chrX remain separated)
5. ExomeDepth CNV calling per sample (autosomal and chrX remain separated)
6. Merge CNV calling files per sample (autosomal and chrX are merged)
7. Convert merged files to VCF
8. Generate index files for these VCF files
9. Annotate VCF files with EnsemblVEP

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,pool,family,cram,crai,vcf,tbi
sample1,poolM,Fam1,/path/to/sample1.cram,/path/to/sample1.crai
sample2,poolF,Fam2,/path/to/sample2.cram,/path/to/sample2.crai,/path/to/sample2.vcf,/path/to/sample2.vcf.tbi
```

Each row represents a sample with the associated pool and family, followed by the optional paths to the CRAM/CRAI and/or VCF/TBI files, depending on which tasks should be executed.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-cmgg/exomecnv \
   -profile <docker/conda> \
   --input /path/to/samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir /path/to/outdir \
   --vep_cache /path/to/vep_cache \
   --exomedepth \
   --annotate
```

to execute the ExomeDepth workflow, followed by an EnsemblVEP annotation on CRAM/CRAI (or BAM/BAI) files provided in the samplesheet. The --annotate parameter is optional. If not provided, only the ExomeDepth workflow will be executed.
It is also possible to run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-cmgg/exomecnv \
   -profile <docker/conda> \
   --input /path/to/samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir /path/to/outdir \
   --vep_cache /path/to/vep_cache
```

to skip the ExomeDepth workflow and only execute the EnsemblVEP annotation on VCF/TBI files provided in the samplesheet.

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
